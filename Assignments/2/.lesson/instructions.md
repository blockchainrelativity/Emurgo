# Assigment #2

  This aims to help you practice problem solving with Haskell and to improve your use on if-then, guards, cases or combinations of them.
   
  ## Problems
  1. **Absolute value of any number**
     
     Create a function named Absolute that takes a value and 
     return the absolute (the number wihtout the sign)
     
     Examples:
     * Absolute 10  = 10
     * Absolute -10 = 10
     * Absolute -11.11 = 11.11

     Create function using if-then, guards and case

    _Bonus:  Try to make any of the functions polymorphic, find 
    any problems? can you explain why? Whats the solution?_


    
  2. **Celsius to Farenheit or Farenheit to Celsisu Converter**
      
     Create a function that takes the letters C for converting 
     from Farenheith to Celsius or
     F for converting from Celsis to Farenheit
     The conversion basic formula   (F - 32) x 5/9 = C


  
  3. **Confortable Temperature in Celsius [18C --> 24C] or 
     Farenheit [64.4ÂºF --> ____ ]**

     Create a function that answers "It's too cold!" if 
     temperature below the range of been confortable, 
     or "It's too hot" if its above and "Its comfortable" if its 
     in range.  
     As in previous assigment you should identify input with C 
     for Celsius or F for Farenheiht
