## Algebraic Data Types
   LETS PLAY TWISTER Part1 
 
  1. Create  custom data type that for Twister Colors: green, yellow, blue, red (suggestion: tColor)
  2. Create another custom data type that handles body parts: Left Hand, Right Hand, Left Foot, Right Foot (suggestion: tBpart)
  3. Create a function that creates a movement, with inputs player number, body part and color 
     and output a tuple with all the info of the movement


 ... AND SOME CHESS
 
  4. Given the following code, include the missing type and data constructors. Given that the pieces in chess are:
  Pawn, Bishop, Knight, Rook, Queen and King, and the posible movements are: Forward, Backward, Left, Right and Diagonal


## HIGH ORDER FUNCTIONS

5. Create a function all' that takes 2 inputs, 
   (1st input ) a partial function (with operators: 
   >,>=,<,<=,==) and any value
   (2nd input) a list,
   and output True if all elements of the 
   functions comply, False if any of the elemnts 
    doesn't, using MAP 

6.  Create anoter version of all, named allF, using 
    FOLDR
